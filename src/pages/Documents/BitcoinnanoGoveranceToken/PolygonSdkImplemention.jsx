        BITCOINNANO is meticulously crafted using the Polygon Crypto Development
        Kit (CDK), an open-source and modular codebase for launching new L2
        chains on Ethereum. By harnessing the power of Polygon CDK, Gelios
        establishes a dynamic and interoperable dApp layer, seamlessly
        integrated with Ethereum and Arbitrum networks.
