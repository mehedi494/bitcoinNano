        While Bitcoin itself does not offer the functionality needed for a
        complex ecosystem, building Gelios as an application layer on top of the
        Bitcoin network presents several potential benefits:

        Bitcoinnano leverages Bitcoin's immutable blockchain for unparalleled security and transparency. In-app economies and digital assets become tamper-proof fortresses, fostering trust and preventing fraud.

        Bitcoinnano introduces novel functionalities and applications to the Bitcoin blockchain. While Bitcoin primarily serves as a store of value and a medium of exchange, Gelios can bring diverse and innovative use cases to the ecosystem.

        <span className="font-bold">- Interoperability:</span> Gelios facilitates direct bridging with Bitcoin, creating a seamless cross-chain interaction that allows users to move Bitcoin and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) across different blockchains. This interoperability is essential in an increasingly interconnected cryptocurrency landscape, where assets need to move fluidly between various platforms to meet the evolving demands of users.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4">
        <span className="font-bold"> - Community Governance:</span> The decentralized nature of Gelios, with its community-managed chain, is a paradigm shift. In contrast to traditional blockchain projects where initial tokens are allocated to developers, Gelios empowers its community to steer the direction of the project.
